ðŸ“¸ Image-to-Story LLM

This project takes an image and turns it into an audio story in three steps:
	1.	Image to Text â€“ The image is captioned using the BLIP image-to-text model from Hugging Face.
	2.	Text to Story â€“ The caption is expanded into a creative story using Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.5 Flash model.
	3.	Story to Speech â€“ The story is converted into speech using Hugging Faceâ€™s ESPnet VITS model.
